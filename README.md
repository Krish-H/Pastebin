# Pastebin-like Application

This is a small web application, where users can quickly store and share text content by generating a shareable link, and view the content using that link.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- A running instance of MongoDB

## How to Run

1.  **Backend:**
    -   Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    -   Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
    -   Make sure your MongoDB server is running.
    -   Run `node index.js` to start the backend server. It will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Frontend:**
    -   Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    -   Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
    -   Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend development server. It will run on `http://localhost:5173`.

Now you can open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to use the application.
